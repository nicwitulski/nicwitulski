### About this Repo
This repo is used to introduce myself and showcase my public projects.

I currently don't have any projects on here besides some old code from my Linux in-terminal game engine. Please visit [this repo](https://github.com/nicwitulski/Linux-Ascii-Engine) to view that project. I have been working on this project for over a year on and off, so it is currently in progress and will be for the forseeable future; though, it is in a working state.

My undergraduate capstone project is on showcase at [this repo](https://github.com/Akoenigs2/SodaShop). There are images, presentation slideshows, 3D printable objects, and code for the UI and backend at this repo. 

Please see the documents folder for my resume and unofficial undergraduate transcript.

### About me
I recently graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with dual Bachelor of Science degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering, finishing with a 3.647 GPA.

During my time at UNL, I was honored to serve as Team Lead of the Lunabotics club, managing a group of 30+ engineering students to design and build a lunar rover. That experience helped me grow as an engineer and a leader.

I’ve held two internships and now work full-time at EF Johnson, where I develop embedded software for public safety radio systems. I work with real-time, multi-threaded C++ code, helping integrate new features and maintain compliance with P25, DMR, and NXDN standards.

I'm passionate about embedded programming, robotic electrical systems, IC chip and PCB design. Leading the electrical design of the Lunabotics rover’s power system deepened my interest in hardware, while my software work at EF Johnson grew my love for embedded development.

I strive to do the best work I can and carry that mindset with me into my career as an engineer.
